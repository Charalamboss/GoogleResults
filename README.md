# GoogleResults
On the first version the "similar results " section was created using 2 Divs , paragraphs and links. I created 1 parent DIV for the  
this section and then i Created 2 childs DIVs in order for the paragraphs to appear one on the left and the other to the right, replicating this way the Google's section.
Hoever , this was causing issues with the float. The next element was appearing on section element
The second version will replce the 2 Divs and the paragraphs with table.
